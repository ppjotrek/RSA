# RSA

RSA algorithm implementation in javascript. Has some nice UI!


FOR NOW: displays RSA algorithm variables, encodes message to ASCII values and encrypts the message with RSA values generated randomly. Decodes message afterwards with previously generated private key. Variables generating range can be set by user.
